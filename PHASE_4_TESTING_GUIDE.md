## üß™ Manual Testing Checklist

### 1. Basic Card Clickability Test
**Expected Behavior**: Activity cards should be clickable and open TaskDetailsModal

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3008
2. Observe activity cards have cursor-pointer styling
3. Click on any activity card
4. **‚úÖ PASS**: Modal opens with activity details
5. **‚ùå FAIL**: Modal doesn't open or wrong content

### 2. Event Propagation Test
**Expected Behavior**: Action buttons should NOT trigger card click

**Steps:**
1. Try clicking these buttons on activity cards:
   - Menu button (‚ãÆ) - should open menu only
   - Quick action buttons (Assign Task, Mark as Open, etc.)
   - Status note buttons (Start Work, Progress Note, Complete)
   - Photo view buttons
   - Expand/collapse sections
2. **‚úÖ PASS**: Each button performs its function without opening TaskDetailsModal
3. **‚ùå FAIL**: Button clicks also trigger card click and open modal

### 3. TaskDetailsModal Functionality Test
**Expected Behavior**: Modal should have comprehensive task management

**Steps:**
1. Open TaskDetailsModal by clicking a card
2. Test three tabs:
   - **Overview**: Shows activity details, assignment info
   - **Updates**: Shows activity updates, add new update form
   - **Actions**: Shows status changes, assignment, edit/delete
3. Test modal closing:
   - X button in top-right
   - ESC key
   - Click outside modal (backdrop)
4. **‚úÖ PASS**: All tabs work, all closing methods work
5. **‚ùå FAIL**: Tabs don't switch, modal won't close, missing content

### 4. Task Management Actions Test
**Expected Behavior**: All task actions should work from the modal

**Steps in Actions Tab:**
1. **Status Changes**: Test changing status (Open ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Resolved)
2. **Assignment**: Test assigning task to different users
3. **Edit**: Click edit button - should close modal and open edit modal
4. **Delete**: Click delete button - should prompt for confirmation
5. **‚úÖ PASS**: All actions work and reflect in the dashboard
6. **‚ùå FAIL**: Actions fail, don't update data, or cause errors

### 5. Updates Tab Test
**Expected Behavior**: Can view and add updates

**Steps:**
1. Open Updates tab in TaskDetailsModal
2. View existing updates (if any)
3. Add a new update using the form
4. **‚úÖ PASS**: Update is added and visible immediately
5. **‚ùå FAIL**: Form doesn't work, update not saved, errors

### 6. Integration with Existing System Test
**Expected Behavior**: All existing workflows should still work

**Steps:**
1. Test existing quick action buttons still work
2. Test menu ‚Üí "Add Progress Note" still opens TaskActionModal
3. Test menu ‚Üí "Task Actions" still opens TaskActionModal
4. Test "Add Incident" button still works
5. **‚úÖ PASS**: All existing functionality preserved
6. **‚ùå FAIL**: Some existing workflows broken
