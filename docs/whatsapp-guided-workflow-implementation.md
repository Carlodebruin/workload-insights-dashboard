                 • Type your update message
                 • Send 'complete' if task is finished"

Staff → System: "Started work, need new screws"

System → Staff: "✅ Update Logged: MAIN-1234
                 📝 Your Update: Started work, need new screws
                 📊 Status: In Progress
                 ⏰ Time: 14:30
                 
                 🔔 Reporter and supervisors have been notified."
```

### 3. Task Completion Flow

```
Staff → System: "/update"
Staff → System: "1"
Staff → System: "complete"

System → Staff: "✅ Mark as Complete: MAIN-1234
                 🏷️ Task: Fix broken desk
                 📍 Location: Room A
                 
                 ⚠️ Confirm Completion:
                 • Reply 'yes' to mark as complete
                 • Reply 'no' to continue with regular update"

Staff → System: "yes"

System → Staff: "🎉 Task Completed: MAIN-1234
                 ✅ Status: Task marked as complete
                 ⏰ Completed: 14:45
                 
                 🔔 All stakeholders have been notified.
                 👍 Great work! Type /assigned to see your remaining tasks."
```

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **WhatsAppCommandSystem** - Main orchestrator for command processing
2. **CommandSessionManager** - Handles multi-step conversations
3. **ReferenceNumberService** - Generates and validates task references
4. **WhatsAppMediaHandler** - Processes image/document attachments
5. **Enhanced Webhook** - TwiML response system for bidirectional communication

### Session Management

The system uses an in-memory session store to track multi-step conversations:
- 5-minute automatic cleanup
- Step-by-step progress tracking
- Cancel option at any point
- Session recovery on timeout

### Command Structure

```typescript
interface CommandContext {
  fromPhone: string;
  senderName: string;
  messageContent: string;
  user?: any;
  requestContext?: any;
}

interface CommandResult {
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
  requiresFollowup?: boolean;
  followupType?: string;
  context?: any;
}
```
