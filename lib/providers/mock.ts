**Overview:**
Your school management system is collecting valuable activity data. Here's what the patterns suggest:

## üìä Key Insights:
- **Activity Distribution**: Maintenance requests dominate (60%), followed by discipline incidents (25%) and sports activities (15%)
- **Peak Times**: Most activities logged between 8 AM - 12 PM and 2 PM - 4 PM
- **Staff Engagement**: Active logging indicates good system adoption
- **Location Patterns**: Classrooms and playground areas show highest activity

## üéØ Recommendations:
- **Preventive Maintenance**: Schedule regular inspections to reduce reactive maintenance
- **Staff Training**: Provide additional support for peak activity periods  
- **Resource Allocation**: Consider additional maintenance staff during high-activity hours
- **Digital Integration**: WhatsApp integration is improving reporting efficiency

## üìà Success Indicators:
- Faster incident response times through automated categorization
- Better resource planning through activity pattern analysis
- Improved staff coordination via structured workflows

*Note: This is a mock AI analysis for development/demo purposes. In production, Claude or Gemini would provide detailed insights based on your actual school data.*`;

Based on your maintenance request patterns:

**Current Status:**
- Window repairs and door issues are most common
- Lab equipment installations showing good progress
- Ceiling leaks require immediate attention

**Recommendations:**
- Schedule monthly facility inspections
- Create maintenance schedules for high-use areas
- Train staff on basic troubleshooting

This analysis would be much more detailed with real AI processing of your actual maintenance data.`;

üéì **School-Specific Analysis:**
- Activity pattern recognition
- Resource optimization suggestions  
- Staff workload balancing
- Predictive maintenance planning

üí° **To enable real AI insights:**
1. Configure CLAUDE_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY in environment
2. Set valid API keys (not test placeholders)
3. System will automatically use real AI providers

**Mock suggestions for now:**
- Review your current school processes
- Look for automation opportunities in activity logging
- Consider staff feedback for system improvements`;

Your school management system is effectively capturing operational data across multiple categories:

## Current Status:
- **51 total activities** tracked across maintenance, discipline, and sports categories
- **Active staff participation** with 5 users contributing to the system
- **Diverse activity types** showing comprehensive school operations monitoring
- **Recent maintenance focus** with window repairs, lab installations, and facility improvements

## Key Patterns:
- Maintenance activities dominate the workload (classroom repairs, lab equipment)
- Geographic distribution shows activity across classrooms, lab, and campus areas  
- Staff assignment working well with activities moving through Open ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Completed
- WhatsApp integration successfully converting incident reports to structured activities

## Optimization Opportunities:
The data suggests good system adoption with room for enhanced workflow automation and predictive maintenance planning.`;
