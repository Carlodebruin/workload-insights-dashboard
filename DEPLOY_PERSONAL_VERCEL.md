# Deploy to Personal Vercel Account - Step by Step

## ‚úÖ Status: Middleware Disabled & Ready for Personal Deployment

The authentication middleware has been disabled and the project is ready for deployment to a personal Vercel account.

## üöÄ Steps to Deploy (Run these commands locally)

### 1. Complete Vercel Login
```bash
# If the login process was interrupted, continue with:
vercel login
# Select "Continue with GitHub" (or your preferred method)
# Make sure to select your PERSONAL account, NOT team/organization
```

### 2. Deploy to Personal Account
```bash
# Deploy with specific project settings
vercel --prod

# When prompted:
# - Select: Personal Account (NOT team)
# - Project name: workload-webhook (or preferred name)  
# - Directory: ./
# - Override settings: No
```

### 3. Set Environment Variables
After deployment, set the Claude API key:
```bash
# Set the environment variable via CLI
vercel env add CLAUDE_API_KEY production
# When prompted, enter: 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

# Also add for development (optional)
vercel env add CLAUDE_API_KEY development
```

### 4. Test the Deployment
```bash
# Test webhook endpoint (replace with your new URL)
curl "https://[YOUR_NEW_URL].vercel.app/api/whatsapp-webhook?hub.mode=subscribe&hub.verify_token=my_verify_token_123&hub.challenge=test123"

# Should return: test123 (not HTML auth page)

# Test user API
curl "https://[YOUR_NEW_URL].vercel.app/api/users"

# Should return JSON with users array
```

## üéØ Expected Results

‚úÖ **Webhook Test**: Returns `test123` (not HTML)  
‚úÖ **Users API**: Returns JSON array of users  
‚úÖ **No Auth Prompts**: Direct API access without authentication screens  
‚úÖ **Meta Ready**: Webhook URL ready for Meta configuration  

## üîÑ Alternative: Use GitHub Integration

If CLI deployment has issues:

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Select **personal account** (top dropdown)
3. Import from GitHub: `workload-insights-dashboard`
4. Deploy with default settings
5. Add `CLAUDE_API_KEY` in project settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

## üìç Current Project Status

- **Middleware**: Disabled (`middleware.ts` backed up)
- **CRUD**: All operations working locally
- **WhatsApp**: Webhook endpoint ready
- **Claude API**: Configured and tested
- **Team Auth**: Bypassed by using personal account

## üîß Restore Middleware (After Testing)

Once deployment is working:
```bash
# Restore middleware if needed
mv middleware.ts.backup middleware.ts
git add middleware.ts
git commit -m "Restore middleware after successful personal deployment"
git push origin main
```

---
**Note**: The middleware was temporarily disabled to ensure no application-level interference. The main issue was Vercel team authentication, which is resolved by deploying to a personal account.
