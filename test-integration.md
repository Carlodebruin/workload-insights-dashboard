# Phase 4.4: Integrated Task Management Testing

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Basic Card Clickability ‚úì
- [x] Activity cards should be clickable (cursor-pointer)
- [x] Clicking card opens TaskDetailsModal
- [x] All nested action buttons should NOT trigger card click (event propagation fixed)

### 2. TaskDetailsModal Functionality
- [ ] Modal opens with correct activity data
- [ ] Tabs work correctly (Overview, Updates, Actions)
- [ ] Modal closes properly (X button, ESC key, backdrop click)
- [ ] Focus management works (focus trap, return focus)

### 3. Overview Tab
- [ ] Displays all activity information correctly
- [ ] Shows assignment status and instructions
- [ ] Shows reporter and assignee information
- [ ] Displays timestamps and status badges

### 4. Updates Tab  
- [ ] Shows all activity updates chronologically
- [ ] Add new update functionality works
- [ ] Update types are handled correctly
- [ ] Photo attachments display properly

### 5. Actions Tab
- [ ] Status change buttons work
- [ ] Assignment functionality works
- [ ] Edit button opens edit modal
- [ ] Delete button works with confirmation

### 6. Event Propagation Fixes
- [ ] Menu button doesn't trigger card click
- [ ] Menu items don't trigger card click
- [ ] Photo view button doesn't trigger card click
- [ ] Expand/collapse section doesn't trigger card click
- [ ] All main action buttons don't trigger card click
- [ ] Quick status note buttons don't trigger card click
- [ ] Activity update photo buttons don't trigger card click

### 7. Integration with Existing System
- [ ] All existing modals still work
- [ ] Quick actions from cards still work
- [ ] Task action modal still works
- [ ] Add incident modal still works
- [ ] All existing workflows preserved

## Test Results

### ‚úÖ Successful Tests
- Development server starts without TypeScript errors
- Application compiles successfully
- AI providers are available and configured

### üß™ Tests in Progress
- Manual testing of user interface interactions
- Verification of modal workflows
- Testing of event propagation fixes

### ‚ùå Issues Found
(To be documented during testing)

## Manual Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Card Interaction
1. Navigate to dashboard
2. Click on an activity card
3. Verify TaskDetailsModal opens
4. Test all tabs
5. Close modal

### Scenario 2: Event Propagation Testing
1. Click various buttons on activity cards
2. Verify they perform their function without opening TaskDetailsModal
3. Ensure only card background/content opens the modal

### Scenario 3: Complete Task Management Flow
1. Open TaskDetailsModal
2. Add an update in Updates tab
3. Change status in Actions tab
4. Reassign in Actions tab
5. Edit via Actions tab
6. Verify all changes are reflected

### Scenario 4: Existing Workflow Preservation
1. Test all existing quick action buttons
2. Test task action modal from menu
3. Test add incident modal
4. Ensure no regressions

## Performance Considerations
- Modal rendering performance
- Virtual scrolling still works in activity feed
- No memory leaks from modal state management

## Accessibility Testing
- Keyboard navigation
- Focus management
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast and visual indicators
